FR017 | Cart Summary Display | As a user, I want a detailed breakdown of each cart item’s customizations. | The /cart page displays item name, selected additions (with price), subtractions, and any user note below the item name.
FR018 | Price Calculation Based on Additions | As a user, I want the final cart total to reflect my selected additions. | Cart subtotal and item price update in real-time based on which priced additions are selected.
